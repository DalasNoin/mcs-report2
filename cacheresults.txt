During our work, we experienced a number of problems. Our Programm executed very differently for each type of tracefile. dbg_px.trf would result in an endless loop in the cpu, ignoring the eof() function of the tracefile. rnd_px.trf would freeze after about 8000 cpu cycles. fft_16_p8.trf would freeze after about 1100 cpu cycles. The problem could not bes resolved even with the help of a teaching assistant. Another problem apeared when writing a number into a sc_inout_rv port, which represents numbers in a base-4 system(1,0,X,Z). a random portion of 1 were flipped to X and had to be converted in line 431.
